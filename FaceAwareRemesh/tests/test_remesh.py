"""The ported constrained remesher, and the dynamic mesh it runs on.

These are the tests for `svremesh/dynamic_mesh.py` and `svremesh/remesh.py` as algorithms.
Run them from this directory with the package importable:

    python -m unittest discover -s tests

Almost everything here is stated as an invariant of the *surface*, not of the code:
manifoldness, group survival, seam deviation, and the cross-norm no triangle may go under.
That is deliberate. The three topological operations are the part of a remesher that goes
subtly wrong -- a collapse that pinches a boundary, a flip that folds a triangle over -- and
the failures do not look like exceptions, they look like a surface a volume mesher refuses an
hour later. So the checks are made here, where the cause is still visible.
