"""Remesh a `ModelFaceID`-labelled surface to a uniform edge length without losing its labels.

Every clustering remesher, and Slicer's own, treats a surface as one sheet of triangles. A
surface that carries `ModelFaceID` is not one sheet: it is several faces meeting along seams,
and those seams are what a mesher's boundary conditions and everything else downstream select
by. Remesh it without knowing that and the labels come back scrambled, the seams drift off
their curves, or a thin face disappears entirely.

This remeshes the *labelled* surface instead. The labels are the mesh's own triangle groups
rather than something looked up afterwards, so every face comes back; the seams between faces
are constrained to their original curves and resampled along them at the target edge length;
and the corners where three faces meet are pinned.

It is not a repair -- a surface that crosses itself comes out crossing itself -- and it is not
a decimator, since it drives toward a uniform edge length. It refuses rather than degrading: a
pass that would leave a degenerate triangle, tear an open boundary, or remesh a face away is
reported and the input is left alone.

`remesh_preserving_faces` is the entry point a host should call. `remesh_labelled_surface`
underneath it is the arithmetic without the reporting, and `remesh_patch_interior` is the
variant that pins an open boundary instead of sliding along inter-face seams.

The remesher is a port of geometry3Sharp's (gradientspace, Boost licence); `remesh.py`'s
docstring records where it departs from the original and why.
