"""The pass a host calls, and the reporting around it.

`remesh.remesh_labelled_surface` is the arithmetic. What is added here is everything a host
shows an operator: the log line, the per-face cell counts, and making `ModelFaceID` the active
scalars so the result draws coloured by face the moment it lands in a scene.

Callers should come through `remesh_preserving_faces` rather than going under it. Two frontends
reaching past it to the remesher is how they start producing different surfaces from one input --
the defaults here are deliberately `None`, meaning "whatever the remesher considers right",
rather than a second set of numbers that could drift from it.
