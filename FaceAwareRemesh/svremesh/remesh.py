"""One remesher, in two modes, and it keeps `ModelFaceID` by construction.

This is a port of geometry3Sharp's constrained remesher -- `Remesher`,
`MeshConstraints`, `MeshConstraintUtil` and `DCurveProjectionTarget` -- onto the
dynamic mesh in `dynamic_mesh.py`. It replaces two remeshers used before it:
ACVD clustering for an initial patch, with the
save-trim-stitch apparatus it needed because clustering cannot hold a boundary at
all, and PyMeshLab's incremental remesher for a sculpted patch's interior, which
could hold a boundary only by freezing a collar of triangles behind it. Both are
gone, and with them pyacvd, PyVista and PyMeshLab -- so this package imports nothing
Slicer's own Python does not ship, and needs no external interpreter.

Measurements below cite three clinical heart cases, called A, B and C. They are the
surfaces this was developed against: a segmented cardiac anatomy capped into a flow
domain, a patch stitched into it along a contour, and the merged result.

The algorithm is the incremental one: a pass over every edge that splits it if it
is longer than 4/3 of the target, collapses it if it is shorter than 4/5, and
otherwise flips it when that brings the vertex valences closer to six, followed
by a uniform Laplacian smoothing pass with every vertex reprojected onto the
surface it started from. What makes it *ours* is the constraint container between
the two: an `EdgeConstraint` per edge and a `VertexConstraint` per vertex, so a
face seam is held while the mesh around it changes, continuously, rather than
repaired afterwards.

**Two modes, and the difference is what a seam is allowed to do.**

`SEAM_SLIDES` is the one most callers want: seam vertices
may be split, collapsed and moved, but they are reprojected onto the *original
seam curve* every time they move, so the seam's geometry is held to a deviation
tolerance while its discretisation is free. That is the difference between
constraining the shape of a seam and constraining its vertex list, and only the
first is load-bearing anywhere. It is what lets seam triangle quality be set by
the target edge length rather than by whatever the contour cut produced: on
case B's merged flow domain the band's worst aspect ratio goes 935 to 8.6 and its
99th percentile 116 to 2.0, and on case A's published domain 2176 to 3.7.

`SEAM_PINNED` is the opt-in strictness: seam vertices are fixed and seam edges
refuse split, collapse and flip alike, so the seam comes back vertex for vertex
identical. A caller that is going to weld something else to those vertices needs
exactly that, and so does one carrying a per-vertex array across the pass by
`GlobalNodeID`.

**Two settings here are not free parameters, and both were measured.** Smoothing
is uniform-weighted rather than g3Sharp's own `MeanValue` default, because
mean-value and cotangent weights both go negative on obtuse triangles: on case B's
28k-triangle domain the library default left 532 triangles under 20 degrees against
uniform weighting's 50. And every position change is gated on the `1e-12` cross-norm
that TetGen refuses a surface at,
because smoothing is the one step in the loop that can take a triangle to exactly
zero area -- 25 iterations at speed 0.1 produced 8 degenerate triangles on the real
flow domain without the gate.

Where this departs from g3Sharp, mostly because the surfaces here are worse
behaved than the library assumes. Each of these was measured against the
library's own rule, on case A's three surfaces and on a sphere and a disc
remeshed to half their edge length -- the last two because the real cases are
near-converged cleanup passes that perform only 30 to 330 flips, so a rule about
flipping barely registers on them:

- A constrained vertex is smoothed using **only its neighbours along the seam**,
  not its whole one-ring. g3Sharp smooths towards the one-ring centroid and lets
  the curve projection pull the result back, which works but spends the
  projection tolerance to buy nothing; using the seam's own neighbours relaxes
  the vertex spacing *along* the curve, which is what a resampled seam wants.
- A move that would degenerate or invert a triangle is reverted per vertex rather
  than clamped, and the revert is re-checked until the mesh is clean. That is the
  degeneracy gate above, applied continuously instead of as a final refusal.
- **Valence error is squared, where g3Sharp's is absolute.** The library scores a
  flip by `|valence - target|` summed over four vertices; `_valence_error` squares
  it. On a closed sphere, where there are no boundary vertices and the norm is
  therefore the only thing that differs, absolute error accepts 2931 flips against
  squared error's 9411 and leaves the worst aspect ratio at 2.66 against 1.55, the
  99th percentile at 2.62 against 1.43 -- and takes *longer*, 3.72 s against
  2.26 s, because the flips it refuses come back as splits and collapses. Squaring
  tolerates spreading one large valence outlier over several vertices; the absolute
  form scores that as no better and refuses it.
- **A boundary vertex's target valence is four**, where g3Sharp targets whatever
  the vertex already has -- which scores any change to it as worse, so the library
  never flips towards a better boundary. Four is the Botsch-Kobbelt value, so this
  is the one departure where g3Sharp is the one leaving the literature. It makes no
  difference on a disc (worst aspect 1.6834 either way) and a large one on the
  pinned patch, where the boundary *is* the seam: worst aspect 9.0 against 14.2,
  which is also the difference between landing under and over the aspect ratio of
  10 `quality.py` counts a triangle at.
- **Unverified, and recorded so it is not mistaken for a decision:** the order
  within a pass is collapse, then split, then flip, where g3Sharp's `ProcessEdge`
  is collapse, then *flip*, then split -- so the library tries to flip a too-long
  edge before splitting it. Measured, this is a wash: the library's order is better
  on the sphere's seam band (1.26 against 1.54) and worse on the disc (2.07 against
  1.68), identical on case A's capped domain, and reaches the same place with
  30% fewer splits. There is no evidence for either, so this stays as it is rather
  than churn on a coin flip. It matters to `QueuedRemesher`, which enqueues the
  neighbourhood of whatever an operation touched: a different order modifies
  different edges and so fills the queue differently.

One measured cost of the two valence departures, since they are a trade and not a
free win: on the patch they leave the *smallest* triangle of any variant tried,
0.0088 mm² against 0.0114 to 0.0129. They buy aspect ratio by spending triangle
area. That is nowhere near the `1e-12` gate, and aspect ratio is what every
downstream stage complains about, so it is the right side of the trade -- but it is
a trade.

    care how short the array is. The vectorised pair stays for `face_band_quality` and
    `_refuse_degenerate`, which are handed a whole surface at once and where it is the right
    shape.

    The cross product is computed once and used for both answers. The numpy path computed it
    twice -- once for the degeneracy gate, once inside `_aspect_ratios`.

    `.tolist()` is what makes this worth doing. Unpacking a position straight out of the
    array leaves `numpy.float64` scalars, and arithmetic on those costs more than the numpy
    call it was meant to replace: 2.8 microseconds against 1.3 for Python floats.

    Returns `(cross, cross_norm, aspect_ratio)`, with `cross` a plain 3-tuple and
    `cross_norm` **not** floored at `1e-30` -- the degeneracy gate has to see a true zero.

class QueuedRemesher(Remesher):
    """The same remesher, visiting only the edges that could have changed -- `RemesherPro`.

    A subclass in g3Sharp and a subclass here, and the reason is worth stating: it inherits
    `process_edge` untouched, so every constraint, gate and bound above applies unaltered.
    The only thing it changes is *which* edges the sweep visits.

    **What it is for.** `Remesher` sweeps every edge every pass, and on the surfaces this
    cleanup remeshes almost every pass is wasted: case A's capped domain performs 85 to
    235 operations per pass against 61,000 edges -- 0.2% -- for all ten passes, and each pass
    costs the same as the first because the cost is the sweep and not the work. So the sweep
    is the thing to shrink.

    **How the queue is fed.** Two sources, and the second is the one that makes it converge:

    - An operation that succeeded enqueues the one-rings of the four vertices around the edge
      it changed. g3Sharp does the same and says of it "TODO: optimize the queuing here, are
      over-doing it!", which is fair -- it is a superset of what actually changed -- but a
      superset only costs a re-test, and missing an edge costs quality.
    - The relax pass enqueues every edge its smoothing took *outside* the length window.
      Smoothing is deliberately not queue-limited -- it moves every vertex, or the mesh would
      relax unevenly -- so without this the queue would go stale the moment a vertex moved.
      This is g3Sharp's `TrackedSmoothPass` and the same rule, `new_len < MinEdgeLength ||
      new_len > MaxEdgeLength`.

    **What it is worth, measured on the surfaces these passes were actually handed.**
    That qualifier is the whole of it: `intermediate/capped_domain.vtp` and
    `intermediate/initial_combined_mesh.vtp` are the *outputs* of the two passes, not their
    inputs, so measuring on them measures a remesh of an already-remeshed surface and flatters
    the queue badly. The real inputs, captured out of a run:

    | input | target / its own median | `Remesher` | this |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | capped domain, 47622 cells | 1.00 | 6.29 s, worst aspect 5.49 | 5.89 s (1.07x), **3.63** |
    | merged domain, 29354 cells | 1.22 | 2.28 s, worst aspect 2.95 | 2.02 s (1.13x), **2.56** |

    So the speed gain is **1.07 to 1.13x**, not the 1.4 to 1.6x the outputs suggested, and the
    real gain is triangle quality. The queue visits about five times fewer edges than the
    sweep and returns a tenth of that as wall clock, because building it costs what skipping
    costs: 2038 collapses enqueue on the order of 49,000 edges through their four one-rings
    each, dwarfing the 2,000 to 4,000 the relax pass contributes.

    **Use it when the target is within about a factor of two of the surface's own median edge,
    which is where both real passes sit** -- exactly 1.00 for the cleanup, since it targets
    that median by definition, and 1.22 for the flow domain's 0.85 mm against its 0.699 mm.
    Swept across a sphere, the queue is 1.04 to 1.09x faster and equal or better in quality
    from 1.0 to 2.0 times its own edge length, and outside that it loses: 0.82x and 0.81x the
    speed at 0.5 and 0.8, and worse quality at 3.0. Note that this is a rule about *edge
    length*, not triangle count -- the flow-domain pass halves its vertex count at a ratio of
    1.22, because coarsening goes as the square.

    The reason is structural and it is upstream's too: **a flip is judged on valence, and the
    queue cannot predict where valence will want one.** Length changes and topology changes
    are what fill it, so valence equalisation only propagates one ring per pass instead of
    sweeping the surface. On the sphere the full sweep performs 9411 flips and this performs
    6542, and running longer does not close it -- 6542 at ten iterations, 6590 at twenty-five,
    6683 at forty, against the full sweep's 9411 at ten. g3Sharp's own remedy is a default of
    25 iterations rather than 10, and measured here even that does not recover it: at 25 the
    queued sweep is 4.06 s and worst aspect 1.80 where the full sweep is 3.99 s and 1.50.

    **Two things g3Sharp does that this does not.** `FastestRemesh` disables surface
    projection on alternate iterations for speed; that is refused here, because
    `remesh_labelled_surface` is documented as unable to move the domain outward -- every
    vertex reprojected onto the surface as it arrived, measured at 0.0000 mm on all three
    example cases -- and half the passes not projecting puts that back in question for a
    speedup this does not need. And `SharpEdgeReprojectionRemesh` is not ported at all;
    nothing here wants triangles aligned to a target's face normals.

    **What it costs.** The result is not identical to `Remesher`'s. Visit order decides which
    of two competing operations wins, so the counts differ and so does the mesh. `Remesher`
    stays as it is, is still what the tests hold to its own trace, and is what this is judged
    against.
